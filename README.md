# Introduction
This is a basic Discord bot to run API commands for Pterodactyl Panel V1 or higher 
alongside with game server monitoring, meaning you can add game servers to the bot
and the bot will refresh information about the game server, for e.g. the current
players listed on the server, using gamedig library.
